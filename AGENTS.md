# Contributor Guide

## Scope

- Keep each change focused on the requested behavior; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Preserve upstream attribution in package metadata, documentation, and notices.
- Do not edit `role_test/` unless a test explicitly requires a fixture change.
- Do not modify `CLAIMS.md` unless the task explicitly requests it.
- Follow existing patterns and reuse existing utilities before adding abstractions.

## Working Practices

- Read the affected code and nearby tests before editing.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes; keep fixtures minimal.
- Use the real CLI and its documented options when validating behavior. Do not invent shell tests or claim checks pass without running them.
- Do not hide lint, type-check, or test failures. Report failures with their command output and distinguish pre-existing failures from new ones when verified.

## Verification

Set up the development environment, then run the applicable checks from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy docsible
```

Run the source-only duplication scan when it is useful:

```bash
npx --yes jscpd docsible --pattern "**/*.py"
```

`jscpd` is informational, not a zero-threshold gate. Current baseline (2026-09-13): 17 clones and 1.02% duplicated lines (down from 21 / 1.30%). Update this baseline only after reviewing intentional duplication — the current grouping and the one known dedup candidate (`role_orchestrator._render_documentation` ↔ `role_analysis.render_analyzed_role`) are recorded in `CLAIMS.md`.

## Verified Baseline (2026-09-13)

- `uv run pytest` passes with 1215 tests (3 xpassed).
- `uv run ruff check .` reports no findings.
- `uv run mypy docsible` reports no issues.

Treat these results as a starting point, not permission to introduce additional failures.
