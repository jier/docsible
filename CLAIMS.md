# Docsible: Verified Project State

Snapshot: 2026-09-13 (updated: Role Execution Graph completion, collection
support fixes, and role-analysis consolidation)

## Purpose

Docsible is a Python command-line tool for generating and checking Markdown
documentation for Ansible roles and collections. It analyzes role structure and
metadata, renders documentation, and provides validation, recommendation,
diagram, configuration, and suppression capabilities.

## Attribution and Identity

- This repository is an explicitly attributed fork of
  [docsible/docsible](https://github.com/docsible/docsible).
- The upstream repository is configured as `upstream`; this fork is published
  as [jier/docsible](https://github.com/jier/docsible).
- Distribution package: `docsible-jier`.
- CLI command: `docsible`.
- Current package version: `0.9.0`.
- Supported Python version: 3.10 or newer.
- The project metadata credits Lucian BLETAN as author and Jier Nzuanzu as
  maintainer.

## Current CLI Surface

The CLI registers these top-level commands:

```text
analyze  check  document  guide  init  role  scan  suppress  validate
```

`docsible role` remains registered for compatibility but emits a deprecation
warning. Use `docsible document role` for the current role-documentation
workflow.

## Development Setup

The project uses `uv` dependency groups. Install the development dependencies
with:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

The package is built with Hatchling and declares its CLI entry point in
`pyproject.toml`.

## Verification Performed

The following commands were run for this snapshot:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy docsible
```

- `uv run pytest`: **1200 passed, 3 xpassed** (was 1156 passed at the
  2026-08-27 baseline; growth is new regression tests for the Role Execution
  Graph, collection-support fixes, and the role-analysis consolidation below).
- `uv run ruff check .`: **all checks passed** (was 47 findings, all in the
  test tree). The 5 findings remaining after the graph work (an undefined
  `click` reference, unused defensive imports, an unused loop variable) have
  since been fixed; the check is now clean.
- `uv run mypy docsible`: **no issues found in 236 source files**.
- `uv run python -m build` and `npx --yes jscpd docsible` were run for the
  2026-08-27 baseline only and have not been re-verified in this snapshot.

## Known Limitations

- There is no GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows`; tests, linting,
  builds, and CLI smoke checks are not yet run by repository CI.
- `RoleInfoBuilder` (`docsible/commands/document_role/builders/role_info_builder.py`)
  is still present as a deprecated, unused-in-production duplicate of
  `RoleInfoLoader`. The role-analysis pipeline (complexity, execution graph,
  recommendations) is now consolidated (see below); role-information
  *loading* still has this one remaining duplicate implementation.
- The deprecated `docsible role` command is still present alongside the newer
  intent-based command groups.
- Collections do not yet resolve cross-role boundaries: `include_role`/
  `import_role` targets pointing at a sibling role in the same collection are
  recorded as `unresolved_external` rather than a real internal graph edge.
  See Next Graph Milestones.

## Role Execution Graph

Docsible now has an internal, renderer-independent `RoleExecutionGraph` built
from the raw Ansible task facts already retained by `RoleInfoLoader`. Its small
interface is `build_role_execution_graph(role_info)`.

- Nodes represent roles, task files, tasks, handlers, variables, and external
  role references.
- Typed edges represent containment, task-file include/import, role
  include/import, task-to-handler notification, and known-variable use.
- Every relationship carries its source location and preserves the resolution
  state: `static`, `dynamic`, `unknown`, or `unresolved_external`. Dynamic
  Ansible expressions are recorded without inventing a target.
- README execution phases are now a static traversal from `tasks/main.yml`;
  conditional paths are annotated and unreachable files are identified rather
  than being presented as filesystem-order phases. The README presents these
  as Execution Routes rather than placeholder phases.
- Component architecture diagrams derive variable and handler edges from graph
  facts, replacing the old first-file and last-file proxy edges.
- Task nodes preserve modern and legacy loop syntax (`loop`, `with_items`,
  `with_first_found`, and other `with_*` forms), and structured
  `loop_control` — `loop_var`, `index_var`, `label` — is captured into the
  task-node metadata and the serialized graph, and surfaced in the README
  Loop column as `loop (as: <var>)`. This makes custom loop variables visible
  (they are loop-local, not role variables) for both humans and external
  renderers.
- Complexity reports retain their structural metrics and add graph metrics:
  statically reachable task files, dynamic and unknown boundaries, external
  role references, loop tasks, notification edges, orphan task files,
  collection dependencies, and conditional decision points. The full
  serialized graph (`nodes`, `edges`) is attached to the complexity report and
  exposed via `analyze role --output-format json`.
- The graph uses standard-library dataclasses for a small serializable core.
  NetworkX is not a Docsible dependency; a future visualization adapter may
  convert the graph for layout algorithms.
- Templated include/import targets are classified, not just marked unknown:
  a target matching `{{ role_path }}/tasks/<literal>` resolves statically; a
  templated target with a literal filename prefix (e.g.
  `install-{{ os_family }}.yml`) resolves to one or more `dynamic` candidate
  edges against in-repo files with that prefix; fully unconstrained
  expressions remain dynamic with no fabricated candidates.
- For roles classified `ENTERPRISE`, the README uses a bounded **grouped
  execution overview** (directory-level groups, dynamic/unknown boundaries
  summarized as counts, orphan files collapsed to one line) instead of a
  detailed per-task-file diagram that would be unreadable at that size. The
  detailed projection is used below a fixed budget (20 task files, 35
  relationship edges, fan-out 8); any signal exceeded switches projection.
- The rendered README leads with product value before task-file reference
  material: Overview → Architecture Overview → Execution Graph Summary →
  Execution Routes → Recommendations → Variable Reference → Task File
  Reference → Handlers.

### Verified External Cases

- `geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker` @ `38be616950679548ae0ba8a81ffcceca1b3090bd`:
  JSON parses, documentation generation succeeds, `main.yml` is Phase 1, and
  the five conditional include boundaries plus actual handler notifications
  render as source-backed relationships.
- `geerlingguy/ansible-role-nginx` @ `5ff0b235006390a0d5666fd4cce7477410982cdf`:
  JSON parses, documentation generation succeeds, `main.yml` is Phase 1, the
  seven OS-specific branches retain their `when` conditions, and `vhosts.yml`
  is reached through its static import.
- `geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql` @ `0a0ea6b728120b3ab3918332d9404bb65836834d`:
  legacy `with_items`/`with_first_found` loops render in task tables; 9 static
  include boundaries resolve; no false orphans.
- `geerlingguy/ansible-role-postgresql` @ `53abdf144de8231b2f2ce0652523eebc3eda7100`:
  mixed `include_tasks`/`import_tasks` boundaries resolve; a 27-file `vars/`
  directory renders without truncation.
- `nginx/ansible-role-nginx` (official) @ `157e0e97406f798bd6f50db37430a78c4269aa92`:
  244 tasks, 31 nested task files, classified `ENTERPRISE`. Verifies the
  grouped execution overview and templated-target classification: 22 dynamic
  candidate edges resolve against in-repo files, 0 unknown boundaries, 0 false
  orphans (was 13 before dynamic-candidate resolution).
- `prometheus-community/ansible` @ `e2f46e17d33651c3c09042aaa9c8f29b87a9753f`
  (the `prometheus.prometheus` collection, 26 roles): first real collection
  exercised end-to-end; verifies collection support fixes and role-analysis
  parity below.
- `dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening` @ `3102eddbd116c5f8c1581aca543d372dbc326764`
  (the `devsec.hardening` collection; loop/condition-heavy; 4 real roles +
  2 uninitialized submodule dirs under `roles/`): verifies the loop_control
  capture (2 `loop_var` usages now render as `loop (as: …)`), the collection
  discovery parity (scan and `--collection` both report 4; the 2 empty
  submodule dirs are skipped/warned and excluded from the index), and the
  ENTERPRISE grouped diagram still reachable via explicit `--graph`
  (`os_hardening`, 125 tasks / 23 files).

### Completed Graph Milestones

1. Preserve loop metadata on ordinary tasks and render it in documentation.
2. Add graph-derived execution metrics alongside structural complexity counts.
3. Replace placeholder phases with source-backed Execution Routes.
4. Preserve static and dynamic cross-role boundaries in a JSON-serializable
   renderer contract.
5. Classify templated include/import targets as static, dynamic-candidate, or
   genuinely unresolved, instead of leaving every templated target as an
   orphan.
6. Add a bounded grouped-execution-overview projection for `ENTERPRISE` roles
   so large role graphs stay readable instead of being suppressed entirely or
   rendered as an unreadable wall of nodes.
7. Consolidate role complexity/execution-graph/recommendation analysis into
   one shared implementation (`docsible/commands/document_role/role_analysis.py`:
   `analyze_role()` + `render_analyzed_role()`), used identically by
   `RoleOrchestrator` (standalone `document role`), `document_collection_roles()`
   (`document role --collection`), and `scan/collection.py::_analyse_role()`
   (`scan collection`). This fixed a real divergence: `scan collection`
   previously computed recommendations without the complexity report and
   silently missed the graph-aware findings the other two paths already had.
8. Give collection roles full parity with standalone roles: every role
   documented via `document role --collection` now gets an identical
   Architecture Overview, Execution Graph Summary, Execution Routes, and
   Recommendations section (previously skipped entirely for collection
   roles).
9. Add a collection-level **Complexity Overview** and **Role Index** to the
   collection README: aggregate role counts by complexity category and total
   task count, plus a per-role table (complexity badge, task count,
   critical/warning counts, top finding) sorted by complexity descending, so
   a reader sees which roles need attention before opening any of them. This
   is deliberately an index of independent per-role facts, not a synthesized
   single "collection complexity" score — a collection has no single
   execution graph the way one role does.
10. Capture `loop_control` (`loop_var`/`index_var`/`label`) into task-node
    metadata and the serialized graph, and surface it in the README Loop
    column as `loop (as: <var>)`. (Candidate 7 finding: source `loop_var`
    appeared in 0 of 2 generated READMEs; now 2 of 2 render, with the graph
    carrying the metadata.)
11. Make collection role discovery consistent: `document role --collection`
    now iterates `ProjectStructure.find_roles()` (the same filter `scan
    collection` uses), so the two can no longer disagree on what is a role.
    Role-less `roles/*` directories (e.g. uninitialized git submodules with
    no `tasks`/`defaults`/`vars`/`meta`) are skipped, warned about, excluded
    from the dry-run count and the collection Role Index, and never written
    into. (Candidate 7 finding: `scan` found 4, `--collection` documented 6,
    and 2 stub READMEs were silently written into empty submodule dirs
    invisible to the parent `git status`; now 4 everywhere with warnings.)
12. Bound the grouped-execution overview for flat task directories. Grouping
    keyed on the first path segment, so a nested layout already compresses
    (official nginx: 31 files → 9 directory nodes, 50 mermaid lines) but a
    flat layout degenerated to one node per file (os_hardening: 23 files → 23
    nodes, 100 lines — the densest diagram in the corpus). Added a hard node
    cap (`_MAX_GROUP_NODES = 10`): when grouping yields more groups than the
    cap, keep the entry point and the largest groups by task count and fold
    the remainder into one `other (N task files)` node; hub fan-out into the
    bucket collapses via the existing edge dedup. Verified: os_hardening
    23 → 11 nodes (100 → 52 lines) with an `other (13 task files)` bucket;
    nested layouts at or under the cap render unchanged (official nginx stays
    at 9 directory nodes, no bucket). Also fixed label pluralization (`1 task
    file` vs `N task files`). This subsumes finding B (nested roles already
    give the bounded multi-level view); finding D stays deferred (see Next
    Graph Milestones).
13. Scale performance of the graph path (found on candidate 8,
    `UBUNTU22-CIS`): `_add_variable_edges` now tokenizes each serialized task
    once (one identifier-regex pass + set membership) instead of a
    per-variable `\b<name>\b` regex scan — graph build 12.7s → 0.3s, edge set
    unchanged (1745 nodes / 2510 edges). The `RoleExecutionGraph` is also now
    built once per command and threaded through `RoleAnalysis`,
    `analyze_role_complexity(execution_graph=...)`, `render_analyzed_role`,
    and `_generate_diagrams` (previously rebuilt 2–3×). CIS `analyze`
    41s → 3s; `document --graph` 40s → 3s.
14. The `RoleExecutionGraph` is the single authoritative counter for
    include/import boundaries: `task_includes`/`role_includes` in the
    complexity report are derived from distinct source tasks of the graph's
    include edges, replacing a separate flattened-task regex that never
    matched the legacy bare `include:` keyword. Fixes the candidate-9
    contradiction (legacy `include:` role reported `Task Includes: 0` while
    its own Execution Routes/diagram showed 20; now 20). Non-legacy roles are
    unchanged (verified docker 5, mysql 9, nginx-official 21, os_hardening
    22). Any future boundary count must read from the graph — not add a second
    scan — to keep this single source of truth.

### Complexity ownership: graph vs residual scans

`analyze_role_complexity` still mixes two kinds of computation. Goal: make the
`RoleExecutionGraph` the authoritative source for as much as is graph-shaped, so
the same fact is never computed twice by two implementations (the
`task_includes`/legacy-`include:` drift was the first instance of this class).

- Derived from the graph (single source of truth): `task_includes`,
  `role_includes`, `conditional_tasks`, `error_handlers`,
  `static_reachable_task_files`, `dynamically_reachable_task_files`,
  `unreachable_task_files`, `dynamic_boundaries`, `unknown_boundaries`,
  `external_role_references`, `loop_tasks`, `notification_edges`,
  `conditional_decision_points`.
- Still computed by separate scans of `role_info` (acceptable structural
  counts, not graph facts): `total_tasks`, `task_files`, `handlers`,
  `max_tasks_per_file`, `avg_tasks_per_file`; meta reads `role_dependencies`,
  `collection_dependencies`; and the non-graph analyzers
  `external_integrations` (`detect_integrations`), `file_details`
  (`analyze_file_complexity`), and the hotspot/inflection detectors.
- Resolved this milestone:
  - `conditional_tasks` no longer has its own flattened-task scan — it is now
    derived from the same graph pass as `conditional_decision_points`, so the
    two cannot drift (previously the first duplicate-scan class instance after
    `task_includes`).
  - `error_handlers` was dead (it scanned flattened tasks for a `rescue`/
    `always` key that is never there, so always 0). It is now graph-derived
    from real block/rescue/always detection; a rescue block counts as 1
    (unit-tested), and roles without rescue/always correctly stay 0.
- Reachability is now a complete, honest partition. Previously a file reached
  only through a dynamic boundary was counted as neither "static reachable"
  nor "orphan" and silently vanished (openstack `ansible-hardening` showed
  "static 2 / orphan 5" for a 20-file role). Now `static_reachable +
  dynamically_reachable + unreachable == task_files` (openstack: 2 + 13 + 5
  = 20), and the misleading "orphan" field is renamed `unreachable_task_files`
  (no inbound edge from any *resolved* boundary), with the graph summary and
  README explaining the three tiers.
- Still open (structural depth, not metrics): the graph flags that a block has
  rescue/always but does not yet model the block/rescue/always control flow as
  first-class nodes/edges, and files reachable only through an *unresolved*
  dynamic boundary (e.g. `{{ pkg_mgr }}.yml`) still read as `unreachable`
  because the graph deliberately does not guess which concrete file runs.

### Next Graph Milestones

1. Publish a documented JSON graph contract after its node and edge fields are
   exercised by more external candidates.
2. Resolve `include_role`/`import_role` targets that point at a sibling role
   in the same collection into real internal graph edges, instead of
   `unresolved_external`. Scoped narrowly to this one relationship (not a
   full collection-wide dependency graph, which was assessed as low value:
   readers almost always want one role's own dependencies, not a map of all
   roles' relationships).
   Status: the primitives already exist — `EXTERNAL_ROLE` nodes,
   `INCLUDES_ROLE`/`IMPORTS_ROLE` edges, the `unresolved_external` resolution
   state, and a now graph-derived `role_includes` count. What this milestone
   adds is (a) resolving a `name`/FQCN reference that matches a sibling
   `roles/<name>` into an internal node, (b) honoring `tasks_from` for a
   precise entry-point edge, and (c) a thin composition layer that joins the
   per-role graphs via those role edges. This is the concrete building block
   for the collection milestone and is incremental on the existing model, not
   a new subsystem.
3. Model block/rescue/always as first-class graph structure (nodes/edges), and
   add source-linked variable scopes, without claiming static certainty where
   Ansible defers resolution. (The `error_handlers` metric is already
   graph-derived from real rescue/always detection; what remains is exposing
   the block control flow itself, not just the count.)
4. Make `graph_visualisation` a renderer adapter over this contract, using
   NetworkX only for renderer-specific layout work.
5. Extend the pinned external corpus before treating the graph contract as
   release-stable.
6. (Finding D, deferred) Surface diagram tiering for `--graph`: COMPLEX and
   ENTERPRISE roles currently render only the file-level architecture
   diagram; per-task-file flow diagrams are shown only for SIMPLE/MEDIUM.
   This is by design (a task-level graph is unreadable at that size), not a
   defect, so no inline disclaimer is added yet. The genuine remedy is to
   expose task-level flow through the interactive `graph_visualisation`
   adapter (item 4), where the "too large for Mermaid" content belongs; the
   README note, if ever needed, should be written once that adapter exists so
   it does not churn.
7. (Finding, deferred — precision, not perf) `uses_variable` edges over-match
   because `_add_variable_edges` marks a variable "used" when its name appears
   as *any* identifier token in `str(task)` — the whole serialized task
   (module name, arg values, `when`/`register`, task-name prose, handler
   names). The (a) perf fix kept this behavior identical (single tokenizer pass
   instead of per-variable regex) but did not narrow it, so the edges can be
   spurious: at CIS scale 1285 of 2510 edges are `uses_variable`, a plausible
   share not real Jinja references. This weakens the JSON graph contract, the
   "which variables does this task read" change-impact answer, and any dense
   interactive variable layer. Planned fix (a deliberate semantics change, NOT
   to be slipped into an optimization): restrict to genuine references —
   `{{ name }}`/`{{ name.attr }}` interpolations and templated arg/`when`
   values (reuse `dependency_matrix.extract_variable_references`) — exclude
   non-reference keys, and treat `loop_control.loop_var`/`index_var` names as
   loop-local so they are not linked to same-named role variables. Because it
   intentionally drops noisy edges (fewer, more-accurate), it needs its own
   tests and review.

## Collection Support

`document role --collection` and `scan collection` were exercised end-to-end
for the first time against a real, non-trivial collection
(`prometheus-community/ansible`, 26 roles) and had several defects that a
smaller/synthetic test collection did not surface:

- `document role --collection ... --dry-run` was not read-only: it wrote a
  README backup before any short-circuit existed. Fixed with an explicit
  dry-run check before any file is touched.
- `meta/argument_specs.yml` files using Ansible's `!unsafe` YAML tag failed to
  load (`could not determine a constructor for the tag '!unsafe'`). Fixed
  with a `DocsibleSafeLoader` that preserves the scalar value.
- The role README template referenced `sections/argument_specs.jinja2`,
  which did not exist, crashing collection documentation for any role with
  argument specs. The template was added.
- The collection-level README template referenced `role.belongs_to_collection`
  in a macro where `role` was never in scope, raising
  `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError` for any collection with a detectable
  repository URL. Fixed: collection-level links always build the `roles/`
  prefix, since collection templates are always in a collection context.
- Nearly every collection template (`overview.jinja2`, `roles_list.jinja2`,
  `galaxy_info.jinja2`, `dependencies.jinja2`, `plugin_list.jinja2`, and the
  `render_arguments_list` macro) was missing Jinja whitespace control,
  producing a blank line after almost every list item, table row, and
  argument-spec field — a generated collection README for a 26-role
  collection was ~8000 lines, mostly blank. Fixed at the template level, and
  `render_collection()` now applies the same blank-line normalization
  (`MarkdownProcessor`) that `render_role()` already applied, capping any
  residual run at 2 consecutive blank lines.
- `sections/overview.jinja2` printed a literal `\n` after every collection
  author name (a template typo, not an escape sequence). Fixed.
- The per-role loop used a raw `os.listdir` of `roles/`, so it disagreed with
  `scan`'s `find_roles` filter and treated uninitialized git submodules
  (empty `roles/*` dirs) as zero-content roles: it miscounted in `--dry-run`,
  wrote stub `README.md`/`.docsible` into submodule paths invisible to the
  parent `git status`, and inflated the collection Role Index. Fixed: the
  collection path now iterates `ProjectStructure.find_roles()` and skips +
  warns on role-less dirs. (Found via
  `dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening`, which has 4 real roles + 2 empty
  submodule dirs under `roles/`.)

## Analysis-path status & merge sequencing

Single-role `document role`, `document role --collection`, and `scan collection`
now share `analyze_role()` for complexity, execution graph, and recommendations.
As of this change they also share **suppression**: `analyze_role()` filters in
one place, so a suppressed finding is consistently excluded from the terminal
view, CI gates, collection role counts, and scan counts (previously only the
single-role orchestrator applied suppression).

Tracked sequencing (technical ordering, not a dated roadmap):
- Suppression is now shared, but `document role --collection` still lacks the
  `fail_on` exit gate that single-role `document role` has. Add it when the
  collection document loop is restructured (collection branch), so CI behaviour
  is consistent across paths.
- Removing the deprecated `docsible role` command and retiring `RoleInfoBuilder`
  is the only *breaking* change and belongs in the 1.0.0 cut. The
  `docsible guide` guides (`getting-started`, `smart-defaults`,
  `troubleshooting`) teach `docsible role` exclusively and their tests
  (`test_guide_command`, `test_brief_help`, `test_cli_integration`) reference it,
  so the guide rewrite must land in the same change that removes the command.
- The hybrid template (`hybrid_modular.jinja2`) does not render the Execution
  Graph Summary / Execution Routes sections that the standard template does;
  reconcile it before freezing the public graph contract, so "the graph is the
  single source" holds for every output path.
- Freeze the JSON graph contract only *after* the collection cross-role work, so
  it locks the final node/edge shape.
- Suppression store resolution (fixed in step 3a). Previously `analyze_role`
  always read the store from `role_path`, while `docsible suppress add` writes
  to the **working-directory** `.docsible/suppress.yml`. `scan collection` and
  `document role --collection` now pass `suppress_base_path = <collection root>`,
  so they read the one project/collection-root store and scope per role via a
  rule's `--file` — matching the documented model (and the metadata-`.docsible`
  file vs store-directory collision can no longer occur for collection roles).
  Residual: single-role `analyze_role` still defaults its base to `role_path`,
  which equals the project root for the common `--role .` invocation but not for
  an absolute `--role /abs/path`; unifying that (e.g. walking up to the nearest
  `.docsible/`) is a small follow-up, not a regression.

## Remaining Duplication Work

The source-only duplication scan is below the original baseline, but remaining
duplication is prioritized by ownership and behavior rather than percentage.

1. **Largely resolved.** Role complexity/execution-graph/recommendation
   *analysis* is now consolidated in `role_analysis.py` (milestone 7), the
   `RoleExecutionGraph` is built once per command and threaded (milestone 13),
   and include/role boundary counts are graph-derived (milestone 14). Used
   identically by `document role`, `document role --collection`, and
   `scan collection`.
 2. **Resolved.** The duplicate complexity scans are collapsed into the graph:
    `conditional_tasks` is now derived from the same graph pass as
    `conditional_decision_points` (one source, cannot drift), and
    `error_handlers` is graph-derived from real block/rescue/always detection
    (was always 0). Reachability was also made a complete partition
    (`static + dynamic-only + unreachable == task_files`) with the misleading
    `orphan` renamed to `unreachable`.
3. Role-information *loading* still has one remaining duplicate: the deprecated
   `RoleInfoBuilder` alongside `RoleInfoLoader` (see Known Limitations).
   Retire `RoleInfoBuilder` and the deprecated `docsible role` command, and
   finish single-path loading, **before** freezing the public JSON graph
   contract (Next Graph Milestones #1) so that contract ships against a
   de-duplicated, stable surface rather than being revised after the fact.
4. Consider a private helper for repeated integration-provider task traversal
   after the role-loader migration is complete.
5. Review overlapping renderer model fields only when a concrete rendering
   change requires them to move together.
6. Remove obsolete duplicate tests and generated fixture backups only after
   confirming they are not test contracts.

### jscpd (source-only, `docsible/**/*.py`) — 2026-09-13

17 clones / 258 duplicated lines (1.02%) / 1414 tokens (1.22%), down from the
prior baseline of 21 clones / 1.30%. Grouped by owner, mapped to the items
above; the ones to actually act on are called out:

- **`role_orchestrator._render_documentation` ↔ `role_analysis.render_analyzed_role`**
  (the `ReadmeRenderer(...).render_role(...)` assembly) — **introduced by the
  step‑3 consolidation**: two render assemblies where there should be one.
  Action: have the orchestrator delegate to `render_analyzed_role` so a single
  path renders. Ties to item 1.
- **`commands/analyze/role.py` ↔ `commands/validate/role.py`** — the two thin
  intent-command wrappers duplicate the same option-stack decoration. Low-risk
  extraction candidate (a shared decorator), cosmetic.
- **`commands/document/role.py` ↔ `commands/legacy/role.py`** — legacy
  duplication; expected to vanish when step‑3b removes `docsible role`
  (item 3).
- **`renderers/models/diagram_data.py` ↔ `renderers/models/render_context.py`**
  and `readme_renderer.py` internal (`render_role` ↔ `render_collection`) —
  renderer-model / renderer-method overlap → item 5.
- Remaining intra-file repeats in `diagrams/mermaid/core.py`,
  `diagrams/sequence/role.py`, `diagrams/types/formatters.py`,
  `repositories/role_repository.py`, `utils/cache.py` — pre-existing, no owner
  overlap with the graph work; leave unless a change touches them.

Only the first item (`_render_documentation` / `render_analyzed_role`) is a
regression *from* our consolidation and worth folding into the dedup pass; the
