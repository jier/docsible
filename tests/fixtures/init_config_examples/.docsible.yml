# Docsible Project Structure Configuration
# This file allows you to customize how docsible interprets your Ansible project structure.
# All paths are relative to the location of this file.
#
# Priority: CLI flags > .docsible.yml > Auto-detection > Built-in defaults

structure:
  # Directory names (without leading/trailing slashes)
  # Uncomment and modify only what you need to override

  defaults_dir: 'defaults'           # Where default variables are stored
  vars_dir: 'vars'                   # Where role variables are stored
  tasks_dir: 'tasks'                 # Where task files are located
  meta_dir: 'meta'                   # Where role metadata is stored
  roles_dir: 'roles'                 # Where roles are located (for collections/monorepos)
  handlers_dir: 'handlers'       # Where handlers are located (for collections/monorepos)
  # For monorepo structures, you can specify nested paths:
  # roles_dir: 'ansible/roles'         # Example: monorepo with ansible subdirectory
  # roles_dir: 'playbooks/roles'       # Example: playbooks subdirectory

  # File names (without extensions - both .yml and .yaml are checked automatically)
  # meta_file: 'main'                  # Meta file name (meta/main.yml)
  # argument_specs_file: 'argument_specs'  # Argument specs file name

  # Test playbook path
  # test_playbook: 'tests/test.yml'    # Default test playbook location

  # Advanced: YAML file extensions to recognize
  yaml_extensions: ['.yml', '.yaml'] # File extensions to scan

# Examples for different project types:

# AWX Project:
# structure:
#   roles_dir: 'roles'

# Monorepo:
# structure:
#   roles_dir: 'ansible/roles'

# Custom directory names:
# structure:
#   defaults_dir: 'role_defaults'
#   vars_dir: 'variables'
#   tasks_dir: 'playbooks'
